# Roadmap

## Current Status: Stable

The `charx` library is currently in its **stable** stage. This means that all the required functionality has been implemented and new features
will not be added unless something changes dramatically.

The primary goals for the stable version are:

- Provide a consistent `char`-like type that implements all the methods
- Provide a full set if `charx::is_*` functions for the new type

Both these goals have been achieved.

## Future Plans

The plan for the indefinite future is to maintain this library and provide security
updates as and when needed.
